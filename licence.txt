As I cannot fully understand licencing terms I cannot 100% back up any person downloading this source. That's just the way things work.
As of my understanding this game isn't allowed a patent, and any name it gets called has the possibility of being trademarked.
Use at your own risk and do as much research as you can beforehand.
Fonts in the game are used by following the SIL Open Font Licence only because the game is unplayable without fonts. I tried my best sticking to the rules.
Use my source code as freely as you wish and even use your own preferred fonts, make hour own images, and also bare in mind copyright laws around the world.
You can make your own app, sell it, give it away for free, print books, divulge the principles behind the game, show your friends, and basically put in the work to use it how you see fit.
It's a bunch of preamble but, hey. Man it's hard keeping everyone happy.
